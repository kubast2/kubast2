- 👋 Hi, I’m Jakub Strzelecki 22.
- 👀 Looking to get in control and reduce distractions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, how to get myself together.
- 💞️ I still need to learn, how to make small chunked commits without rewritting my changes.
- 📫 strzelecki9jakub8@gmail.com
- 💻 I know C, Python(including oop python).
- Still not in a habbit of making well written commits.
- *Nix > NT; nvim > vscode.
- Dislike broken UX and software that gets in my way.
